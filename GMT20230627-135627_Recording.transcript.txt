00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.600
Nim Dvir: I am a going to do a quick poll question

2
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.780
Nim Dvir: in.

3
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.190
Nim Dvir: and the questions about the exercise that you had to do over the weekend. And

4
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.809
Nim Dvir: how was that

5
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.510
Nim Dvir: exercise?

6
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.390
Nim Dvir: And I remind you that the exercise are worth a bit

7
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.359
Nim Dvir: more points in. So I'm going to ask you easy.

8
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.280
Nim Dvir: Oh, sorry a second.

9
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:17.180
Nim Dvir: Okay, so I'm gonna launch this, then a poll, just to get things started. So if you don't mind. And so the poll questions, how is the exercise for you.

10
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.089
Nim Dvir: are you here? Are you with me

11
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.120
Nim Dvir: just to see that you are here?

12
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.050
Nim Dvir: Okay, it. So the majority city was so so.

13
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.450
Nim Dvir: and

14
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:49.809
Nim Dvir: I mean the bad news is that this was the easiest one. You know. The exercises are just going to get higher and harder, and you really cannot do well

15
00:01:49.810 --> 00:02:11.560
Nim Dvir: without doing the readings. So it's up to you. I mean your students. You have to be responsible for yourself. It's up to you to make sure that you are doing the readings. A. I will go over the answers I already created the exercise. So you're gonna have you have the grades on by space. And

16
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:40.750
Nim Dvir: it's gonna be more complicated as we move on. I remind you that you're doing a full semester here in less than 6 weeks, meaning that it's a very, very, very packed course. And I I I need to follow the requirements of the university, since the course is worth 3 credits, so it has to be the same course. It just needs to be more packed because the time is shorter. I, personally, as a student, I prefer that. And just to get things out of the way.

17
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.050
Nim Dvir: But it it also means that you have to work harder. So if you didn't read it.

18
00:02:46.400 --> 00:03:08.170
Nim Dvir: then you're gonna be in trouble. So it's basically your responsibility a as much as possible. I'm gonna go over the answers. I'm just gonna ask one more poll. And this is an important one. I see that not a lot of you here, which is also disappointing it. It just means that people are not taking it seriously. And and the question is, did you do the reading

19
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:19.599
Nim Dvir: and the reading this week? I asked you to read the most important it to read Chapter 2 in the Conquy book in the database concepts book. So did you do the reading?

20
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.700
Nim Dvir: Yes.

21
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.920
schemed

22
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.890
Nim Dvir: and no.

23
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.220
Nim Dvir: So I'm gonna launch. So did you reach up to 2 in the crunky book.

24
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.320
Nim Dvir: The

25
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:08.560
Nim Dvir: okay? So the majority of you schemed it. I I I see that not everyone is participating in the survey. So if you're here and you're not in the survey. So

26
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:15.810
Nim Dvir: basically, it's like, you're not here. A, I also use this for attendance. So and

27
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:42.059
Nim Dvir: it so, I strongly, strongly encourage you. I mean, there's a limit to what I can do and think. I can go to your homes and force you to read, but in that can only an advocate and repeat myself over and over that you really need to read chapter 2. In order to do well. Chapter 2 talks about the relation new model, which is what I'm going to cover today. So before I go into the

28
00:04:42.150 --> 00:05:06.919
Nim Dvir: Into the lecture, I'm gonna share my screen, and I'm gonna show you the answers that I have for the first exercise, meaning also that once I'm showing it to you now, they they won't be any late submissions, because I'm basically giving you the answers. So if you submit it until now, then, you find you're all degraded. If you didn't, then you're gonna get a 0 for this

29
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:15.940
Nim Dvir: and he just needs to do well. A on the rest of the things, So I am a sharing my screen.

30
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.330
Nim Dvir: I will share this screen. I hope you can see.

31
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.100
Nim Dvir: Okay, so

32
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:29.139
Nim Dvir: please let me know in the chat if you can see my screen. So it was.

33
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:53.930
Nim Dvir: as as far as I'm concerned, a very easy exercise, just because it's 3 questions. And it's very, very basic. So, and it describes a spreadsheet spreadsheet is still not a database. It's this stuff before it. It's just like, you know, it's from. So it's spreadsheet with columns and row the first one is equipment, and you have the columns and number description.

34
00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:18.920
Nim Dvir: acquisition, date at position price. You then have a a. The second one is a company spreadsheet with different columns about the company, A third one is also about a company with more columns about the company. This one also have the president name that already. Should it trigger you that to see that there's more than one theme here a, then the a computer and spreadsheet

35
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:34.700
Nim Dvir: with a columns about the computer, and he a spreadsheet about persons A that we have here. The name did of Hire Department Department is already in and you a theme, a project project manager. So

36
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:45.279
Nim Dvir: here we see that there's a lot of things. So the first question indicate the number of things you think the spreadsheet include and give an appropriate name for each.

37
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.560
Nim Dvir: a for each theme, and you also need to a and

38
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.979
Nim Dvir: and state your assumption. What if I'm going to it? I see, there's a question in the chat.

39
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.520
Nim Dvir: Hmm.

40
00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:18.270
Nim Dvir: just yes. Okay. So The first, a concept that we learned in this class is that each table needs to only have one theme, meaning one topic. Each table covers just one topic. We do that in in order to and not mix things up and to keep it organized, and not to repetition and to keep it efficient.

41
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:35.470
Nim Dvir: So let's go to the first column equipment. You only have one theme. You see, it just talks about the equipment, the number of description, acquisition, price. I don't see any repetition here. So one theme for A. B. We have 2 themes. What does it mean?

42
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.580
Nim Dvir: I'm be in?

43
00:07:38.650 --> 00:08:03.650
Nim Dvir: We have the company, and but we also have the officer. So why do we break it up into 2 things, company and officers. Because, let's say, we have multiple officers working for the same company. So we have officer, name, officer, Jerry, Officer Jesse. All of those officers. So every role in the table. We also need to write, repeat ourselves, and write the name of

44
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:28.650
Nim Dvir: of the company. We all work for you all, but so you all. When you open you open you, we repeat multiple times with different officers. It's very inefficient. The next question ask you a modification problem. That's a modification problem. If you have to repeat ourselves multiple times. So 2 themes in one that's not good. A currency has only one theme, just one company. Let's assume that there's only one

45
00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:53.649
Nim Dvir: one president for the company. So just one, the also one computer. If we determine that they can model. And if they make a monitor and determine this step in this capacity. So there's no repetition. A. We can have 2 themes if we assume that we can model, do the term. So if we have a petition here in the computer, we have an let's say, del latitude that let it.

46
00:08:53.650 --> 00:09:14.899
Nim Dvir: for example, and then different types of computers. Then that's 2 columns we put together latitude in one column, and then the different serial numbers in a different in one table, and the different serial numbers in a different table. That the spreadsheet that I am interested in is E, because this one has multiple things. It's very inefficient.

47
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:40.059
Nim Dvir: A. I counted a 4. So first one is a person for employment, then we have a theme for the department, a theme for project, and a team for assignment. So 4 different themes in one spreadsheet, a meaning that if we fill it like this, it's just us repeating yourself every time, every instance so different people. So it's a

48
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.680
Nim Dvir: sorry. And so

49
00:09:44.790 --> 00:10:05.290
Nim Dvir: we repeat the different people that were higher than you could places. Every time we we, we write a different person. We also need to write the name of the departments. They we also need to write the projects and the project manager. This is very, very complicated. Not how we do it. We use a relational, a databases in this instance.

50
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:30.760
Nim Dvir: So that's not the good way to do it. And so let's talk about notification problems, what notification problem meaning, what can go wrong when we insert data or update data with the lead data, basically when we do any changes in the table. So for B, the one with the company and the officers. If if a company change industry code, there may be inconsistencies. So

51
00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:50.779
Nim Dvir: just think about when you have to to a put the data multiple times, if you or or to change it multiple times. Let's say the industry code is ABC and it changed to Cba. We have to change it a hundred times right? Instead of just changing it once. So that's a modification problem. Same thing.

52
00:10:51.340 --> 00:11:16.340
Nim Dvir: a. We can say the same thing for D, or we can say, if we have to insert data, we have to insert the same data. Otherwise we are liking the data and E, and there's a lot of inconsistencies. So, for example, let's say, we, as a new project manager. So a we have to put, we have to put the same person multiple times, let's say.

53
00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:26.340
Nim Dvir: now we are all in the same project. A. The project manager name is Elliot Rich, the department head. Let's say he's replaced by Kevin Williams. We have

54
00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:48.019
Nim Dvir: 100 people under him, and we have to write Kevin Williams a hundred times right. That's very inefficient. We only want to write to us. And the solution for this is relational database. Then a let's break up the A themes into multiple tables. Now, we use something that's called schema

55
00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:59.470
Nim Dvir: a. This is a schema. In the schema. We write the name of the table in the upper case. Then we open parentheses, and we write the name of the columns. Each current starts with an app

56
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:23.789
Nim Dvir: with the uppercase, and then it regular so, and it's the same thing. So it's equipment. B, we have 2 tables. One is a table for company with a company Id name industry, code in growth sales, the other is for officers. So the officers and the companies are in 2 different tables that connected together in Keith A, which I'm going to explain today. So you see, the company Id here

57
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:30.140
Nim Dvir: points to the company here. See, we have one table company, and the

58
00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:53.929
Nim Dvir: let's say we break it. So we have one for computer serial number make and model, and the other one. And if we make a model that just a a give, the details about the making the model. And for E, we have 4 different tables. So one for person with the person Id. Every. Every table has to have a unique key. That's just a unique identifier of each role.

59
00:12:53.930 --> 00:13:00.320
Nim Dvir: So we have a personal Id. We have their name, then they of hire, and the department name

60
00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:24.540
Nim Dvir: either the and that's all we have for the department in the department table where department name, and then the department manager. So if the manager changes like the example that I gave you, let's say, area which is being replaced by Kevin Williams, which we just change it once here in the department table. So we just change here one time and then changes for everyone. Do you understand? This is the beauty of relational models

61
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:52.730
Nim Dvir: that you will only change this once in one table. We don't want to change it a hundred times for everyone in in the project we have projected the project manager A, and then in the assignment project to the person id and number of hours. So let's say, I work on a project that's called the ATM. 3. I I walk on it like in 6 h a week, and my project. A manager is at rich. I don't have to write it multiple times.

62
00:13:52.730 --> 00:14:10.589
Nim Dvir: I only write it to once. The project is 3 30 vit. And 330, Elliott, which is the manager. And and that's it. I only write it once, and that way we prevent justification problem like Updating like the leading like inserting, and all of that

63
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.819
Nim Dvir: any questions please use the chat if you have any questions for me.

64
00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:26.359
Nim Dvir:  I feel like you are a bit tired today, and it's only the second week people. So

65
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:27.510
Nim Dvir: let's wake up.

66
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:47.519
Nim Dvir: Okay, hey? Please use the chat to ask questions. I'm gonna go over the slides. The slides are available to you on a blackboard. As sorry we are bright spacing so on, Brightspace. I hope you manage to do it and and that you on run to too many difficulties.

67
00:14:47.520 --> 00:15:09.990
Nim Dvir: So we are. In our second week this week. You had to read first of all, of course, check to one in the current key book, but also chapter 2, the the one that that deals with a relational model. So I want you to read. Chapter 2 a. On Thursday we'll do a quick introduction to access.

68
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:21.039
Nim Dvir: And today I'm just gonna go over the theoretical part about the relation tomorrow. So if haven't done so, please jump in and read check to to thoroughly.

69
00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:27.950
Nim Dvir: The purpose of this chapter is to provide you with the conceptual foundation of relational model

70
00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:53.050
Nim Dvir: to understand how relation the fair for non relational tables learn the basic terminology, learn a why do we use keys? What our keys? A. A. Why are they important? A. How do keys represent relationship between tables? A. In, why circuit keys? What is the functional dependency? And, very importantly, how we normalize a table. So these are all

71
00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:59.710
Nim Dvir: a fundamental concept in in database, design, and management. So

72
00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:22.900
Nim Dvir: what is a relational model? And why is it important? It? I would say, the relational model is the most important a concept in database, a in the in the world of databases. It basically means that instead of having all the data in one table, we break it into multiple tables that are relating to one another.

73
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:47.879
Nim Dvir: Okay, so this, the most important part of database. That's basically what separates database and other and and just regular spreads in database. We have multiple tables that are connected together a, we connect them using keys, each keys indicate a different roles. So that's how we connect them and and we use it in order to maintain the efficiency

74
00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:56.969
Nim Dvir: of the design. So a our goal is not to repeat, not to repeat ourselves, and not to have a redundancy. So

75
00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:21.390
Nim Dvir: in in each table we have one theme, one, let's say one for the activities, one for roads. And then when we connect them together, we can create a different tables. But a, the data is kept separately, and then we don't have to repeat ourselves. So let me just go over. The terminology is slowly. First of all, entity entity is everything that we represent in a database. It's just

76
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:34.359
Nim Dvir: a unique object that we will present a. For example, people, products, organization. All of those things are entities. What we represent in database are engages just the terminology.

77
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:59.899
Nim Dvir: And so, for example, here, entity, it's a thing. So we can have an entity for a and an entity for songs. So let's imagine that we have a table for artists and a table for songs. Why do we keep it in a relation? What? Why do we have a table for artists and a table for some separately. Why don't we put it in the same table? So, for example, we have a table.

78
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:12.939
Nim Dvir: and we have Taylor Swift. We have Adele, we have Rihanna, and then we have a table for songs, with all the Taylor, swift songs with all the Adele Phones and all the Rianna sons. Why do we keep it separately

79
00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:19.030
Nim Dvir: in the chat, please? Who knows? Why do we want to keep it separated and not do it in the same table

80
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:27.099
Nim Dvir: participate. So I can see that you're with me.

81
00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:29.180
Nim Dvir: Why do we keep it separately?

82
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.300
Nim Dvir: Okay. To have one theme

83
00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:58.479
Nim Dvir: to avoid repeats exact. Very good. Second, that's what I was aiming for. So Taylor Swift has multiple phones a. Instead of just writing Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift toilet with a hundred times. We just write the key just what symbolizes tell us which. So let's say she's number one in the table artist. Then we just write one, and then the name of this 1 one name was a

84
00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:11.289
Nim Dvir: same for Rihanna. Let's say Rihanna is number 3 in our table. We'll just write 3 name of the song, and then we don't have to repeat ourselves. And then, let's say Rianna decided to change her names.

85
00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:34.379
Nim Dvir: There's something add a name to, so we just add the name once in the table artist, and we don't have to name to to do the change, and merely a hundred times because she has a lot. She has a very big repertoire. We don't have to change it a lot of times, so I think that you got it. That's a good answer. So entity is not a table to the entity. Just to think a when we

86
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:55.859
Nim Dvir: they talk about tables, we also use the word relation. So from now on. They just know that when I say it relation, I mean the table. It's just a term that we use interchangeably. So relation is a table table is a relation, basically 2 dimensional table with rose and columns. So relation is

87
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:57.820
Nim Dvir: a table.

88
00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:12.110
Nim Dvir: And this is an important slide. Just keep it for your records it. It gives you all the basic, a characteristics of a a proper relation, a proper table. So

89
00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:20.239
Nim Dvir: at the at the relation or at the table. Each role contains data about a different entity. So let's say, you have a table for artists.

90
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:37.700
Nim Dvir: the S. These artists. Each row contains data about a different artist, Jana Adel A. Taylor Swift and Harry styles all of that. A columns contain data about attributes, so we can have a column first name, a last name.

91
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:51.649
Nim Dvir: age, a country of origin. Things like that that are just characterized, the a entity, a. So that's the columns. They they are common, For all the instances. So

92
00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:59.790
Nim Dvir: a columns are a attributes in a relation. Characteristics sales in the table. They hold

93
00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:22.330
Nim Dvir: one single value. You can have multiple values within the cell. So let's say we have a column that says birth here. We can only have one number there we can have multiple numbers, a country of origin. Just one. If they have 2, then they have to be in separate roles. A. All entries in the column are of the same kind, so if a column is a birth year, it holds to be numbers.

94
00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:28.260
Nim Dvir: Why does all entries in a column needs to be of the same kind of the same data.

95
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:40.939
Nim Dvir: So we have to define why, first name, as if we define it, has to be a text. It has to be a text for everyone and birth. Here we decide. It's a number. It has to be a number for everyone. Why.

96
00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:42.400
Nim Dvir: please use the check.

97
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.120
Nim Dvir: hey?

98
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:52.640
Nim Dvir: Consistency? But by.

99
00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:59.909
Nim Dvir: But let's let's do it. Let's think of practicality like, okay, consistency. That's nice. But what actually can happen?

100
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.830
Nim Dvir: Why, like, what's the actual reason

101
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.430
Nim Dvir: not just to make it look nice and pretty

102
00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:27.689
Nim Dvir: a void. Nol is closer. But no, actually, it's not that sorry. My video is a little jumpy. And no, it's not just not just no values, you know.

103
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:33.770
Nim Dvir: because nor can can happen. Okay, I'll tell you

104
00:22:33.860 --> 00:23:03.689
Nim Dvir: for operations, right? Because when we run an operation, you see on the database, if we mix text and numbers, then it's going to be a mess. So if you remember, I showed you data types in this a lecture. So if it's a number. Then we can do. We can edit, we can summarize, we can, we can multiply it, we can average it. We can do all those things which we can do with text. We text, we can change it up with a slower case which we can do with numbers. So it depends so that basically defines which operations and can do.

105
00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:31.309
Nim Dvir: Each column has a unique name. That's kind of like self. that's that's pretty obvious. But that's a a and make sure we understand it. Each calm has to have a unique name because we use it for different operations. So it's a database needs to know which call we are referring to. So we can have the same name to to different columns. Each call has to have different names. Just so that say just so when we run our operation they will, as the Davis will know.

106
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:56.399
Nim Dvir: what are we talking about? And the all of the comes is usually not important doesn't matter if the birth year come after the the control origin. All that the order of the roles is also not important in a usually no 2 rows may hold identical sets of data values because they will create a repetition. And also if the database, when we refer to a row, if there's 2 more than one row it, it will get mixed up.

107
00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:27.110
Nim Dvir: So no identical values. These are the rules of the good table. Keep it and remember it. And now we talked about a schema schema is when we describe textually a database. It just describes the structure of the database, the name of the table, or the relation has to be written in all caps and and a. The columns are inside the parentheses, and they the first. Only. The first letter is capitalized, and that's how we describe

108
00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:32.970
Nim Dvir: a a, a, a table. So, for example, here we have

109
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:54.620
Nim Dvir: a a table for a text. The first one is the right one. The the first column is usually the a primary key, the identification. So here in the textbook, it's Isbn is a unique number that identify books. There's no repetition there. So each textbook has a unique Ica.

110
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:59.650
Nim Dvir: Oh, so I'm a little sick. And

111
00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:26.340
Nim Dvir: so we have the column. Ipn, then title, publisher, and copyright. This is Schema. This is how we describe a textbook. The second example is not good, because you see that there's a column that says authors, it has multiple values that's not good. We can't have multiple values inside one column so that can happen. And also this is not a good example, because we can't have the same columns

112
00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:36.180
Nim Dvir: and with the same name. So if we insist, we can have also one, also 2, or 3. But I would just prefer to have author in a different table and then create a relationship.

113
00:25:36.180 --> 00:26:01.170
Nim Dvir: That's better, But this is a schema. This is how you write and describe a database. So let's talk about the terms. And first of all, a table can also be called the file or a relationship. We'll use those terms interchangeably table file relation relation table, the things inside the tables we have robes. We can also call them records, or to

114
00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:29.360
Nim Dvir: usually use records or instances as well. It so rows are inside a table, and we have columns that the columns can also be called fields or attributes. They are all the same things. So it's the same terms, columns A and comes in rows outside the table. We also have attributes and records. There's a relationship. So just know those terms when you see them. Just know that field a means

115
00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:35.769
Nim Dvir: the the values of a column or attribute and a role can be record. And table is a relationship.

116
00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:41.990
Nim Dvir: If you have any questions, please use the chat. If not, I'm just moving on in.

117
00:26:42.040 --> 00:27:07.029
Nim Dvir: Now let's talk about keys. Keys are a fundamental for relational database keys are basically the identifiers of the roles. So each role needs to have a key. So it's key is one or more columns. It can also be a few that are used to identify a role, a, a think of the door, a key is what opens the door? A. If we have more than one attribute.

118
00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:14.569
It's as a key. It's called the composite key. If it's like, let's say first, the last name, a candidate keys everything that's unique.

119
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:39.090
Nim Dvir: A, and the primary key is a a what we chose to use as our key. So the database management system, a will use it to uniquely identify each role in a relationship. The the primary key in the relationship will be underlying in the schema we underline the priority. So from now on moving on forward when you write a a relation, when you write it.

120
00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:46.930
Nim Dvir: when you describe, you have to underline the primary key that's crucial and in order for

121
00:27:47.350 --> 00:28:12.329
Nim Dvir: in order for us, or or whoever widget to know what your primary key is. And I repeat, it's super important to define and identify a primary key, because and this is the value that I use to retrieve the data from the road. So let's say, we have a student table for all of us here. So a primary key will be our student number. And let's say, I want to call

122
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:20.300
Nim Dvir: out to Sofia, so, Sophia, I just pull out number 3, for example, why don't I use a

123
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:32.020
Nim Dvir: for example? Your first name is a primary key. Why a your first name? I will not use it as a primary key for my own. For my own table. Please use the chat to to answer.

124
00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:45.529
Nim Dvir: So I have now a table, a relationship with all of you guys it to keep track of your great. So let's say, and I use your a student. Id. Why don't I use your first name as a primary key.

125
00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:49.340
Nim Dvir: Let's see what you're saying to check.

126
00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.540
Nim Dvir: Why don't the chat? Why do I use your first name

127
00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:29.079
Nim Dvir: exactly can be repeated. We can have 2. Sophia is in in this class. This is a small class, but and I I I'm sure you know that during the semesters and I have the same class with like 200 people in it. So we can have multiple people with the same name. Multiple people that that are called a Jason multiple people will call Z a multiple Christopher's. And

128
00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:39.150
Nim Dvir: so it it's not a good. It's that it's a candidate key, and it's a primary key. Because, let's say, I want to pull up the data. If for Christopher, I want to pull out your

129
00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:50.510
Nim Dvir: your great, if all a pull out using Christopher, the database will not know which, Christopher I mean right? And and it wouldn't know which instance of which

130
00:29:50.700 --> 00:30:06.379
Nim Dvir: which in a data I'm referring to. So it's not good if I want to do a if I want to do a great check for Sophia, right? You come to my office and you say, Hey, please, from your my grades. I can't answer you if if I don't have a key for you, if I can pull you up

131
00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:22.830
Nim Dvir: of the system. So Sophia is not good because we have, we can potentially have multiple people. So a key has to be unique. So for example, let's look at a table called employee. This is a schema. So usually we use a number

132
00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:29.130
Nim Dvir: a, because it's unique. It's easy to a right. We underline it. It's

133
00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:54.280
Nim Dvir: Best practice is to use it as the first, a column, a in our schema, so we underline it. And this is our primary key. This is how we identify. So I want to pull up a information about employees, let's say, with your employees, I use the employee. Number 1, 2, 3, 4. I don't use the first name, not the last name. That's the department that the email and that the phone, Because they're not unique.

134
00:30:54.280 --> 00:31:08.139
Nim Dvir: My email can be unique. And so that can be a candidate key. What can be an issue with an email? Why wouldn't I recommend a for you to use an email address as a primary key? Because technically.

135
00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:16.150
Nim Dvir: you don't have multiple emails? Right? Each each of you has a unique email. Why wouldn't I recommend using an email as a primary key?

136
00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:22.060
Nim Dvir: What do you think?

137
00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:29.190
Nim Dvir: Why wouldn't you? Why shouldn't you use an email as a primary key?

138
00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:38.980
Nim Dvir: Oh, you think people

139
00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:43.829
Nim Dvir: come on, just try.

140
00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:48.690
Nim Dvir: Hmm.

141
00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:56.620
Nim Dvir: emails change. That's a good idea. I didn't think about that. Yeah, email changes true. Because and

142
00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:12.339
Nim Dvir: okay. But let's say that, that's a true point of the problem. Let's say that now we're in Albany. And and we get our all going to do email. And we pretty much stick with the same email. So let's let's not use that. Let's say, emails stay the same.

143
00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:23.450
Nim Dvir: I'm with the same email for all of my years in Albany have been in open for many years. And same email. What what else can be a reason not to use? That is a primary key.

144
00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:39.739
Nim Dvir: Dipole. That's a good, that's a good direction. And and that's what I mean. A emails are complicated. I'm not numbers. They have a it can be uppercase. It can be lowercase.

145
00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:50.730
Nim Dvir: It's hard to write it. A lot of letters. It's complicated. It has an at sign. It has unique signs. It has a lot of things that are a

146
00:32:50.920 --> 00:33:15.190
Nim Dvir: technically possible but not a good practice, especially if you're dealing with very big databases. Numbers are much, much, much easier. So let's say, I want to pull up the data for Stephanie and I excellently write, The email in upper case? Then I won't get the value instead of just using the student number 1, 2, 3, 4, whatever, then I will find

147
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:41.050
Nim Dvir: much easier. So always a prefer to a use numbers just best practice. They use that as a primary key. So this is a schema a here this is how it looks like describes a table a. I expect you from now on a first of all, to know how to read this to know what it's simple, but also know how to write it. So when you describe tables in your exercises and in your

148
00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:46.050
Nim Dvir: work, describe them, using the schema looking like this.

149
00:33:46.100 --> 00:34:10.330
Nim Dvir: And so we said that unique keys identify one and only one row. So a in the textbook Ispn only A is is the primary key. Because, Ipn, it's a unique number that only refers to one text. So we if we want to pull up a textbook, we just use the primary key. So a a private key has to be unique and simple.

150
00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:18.899
Nim Dvir: just for one. So for you guys, it will be your student Id or your net, or anything like that that's unique.

151
00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:20.219
Nim Dvir: And

152
00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:29.929
Nim Dvir: a now, we also have something that's called a composite key. Composite key is when we use 2 attributes together to A and

153
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:51.019
Nim Dvir: to have a primary key. So let's say, we have a table for apartments, and we have a building number apartment number number of bedrooms and rent. Why do we use? Why building number and apartment number together? They both underline together a primary keys. Why do we need to use both of them, in order to have a primary key.

154
00:34:51.540 --> 00:35:03.189
Nim Dvir: Please answer the check. This is important. Why do we use apartment? And why do we use a building number and apartment number together, not just building or just the apartment number

155
00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:07.229
Nim Dvir: in order to identify a unique apartment.

156
00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:22.649
Nim Dvir: Exactly so. Not only that apartment numbers are repeated. okay. So first of all, apartment number are repeated. Let's say we live in on

157
00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:35.130
Nim Dvir: 343 streets. We have multiple. A, we have a multiple buildings here. All the buildings have the same, pretty much same. A a

158
00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:58.540
Nim Dvir: scheme of of how they describe the apartment, probably one apartment, 2 apartment to be a part of it. We don't know which one, and also just the building is no good because we are building one. We have building 2, we have building 3 by doesn't refer to a so an apartment. So only together, a building number and apartment number together identify just a unique apartment.

159
00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:23.350
Nim Dvir: Okay, I want to say, by the way, and so this class, I'm taking notes of people who participate. If for bones points afterwards. So Christopher and, Stephanie, you're doing a very good job in a in participating, and I'm taking notes for that. And I appreciate it. So thank you. And participation is important if you see that you're not doing so well in your exercises in your answer.

160
00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:40.149
Nim Dvir: This is the way to get bonus points and to make me, and at the end of the class, maybe give you a little bump. So, and a thank you for participating. It helps me it to the class. It makes things more interesting. So thank you for that. so primary key.

161
00:36:40.150 --> 00:37:05.139
Nim Dvir: it's identical in the purposes to identify a role in the grow. And if if we refer to it from a different table. It's called the foreign key. So a foreign team is when we identify a primary key from a different table. So this is how we create the connection between the tables. I'll show you that in a very soon. Second, I think I'm so sick. I'm sorry just to say that you know as well

162
00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:08.830
Nim Dvir: sorry. And

163
00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:31.170
Nim Dvir: so it helps organize the relationships. And this is how we index and search and do all those stuff. I'll show you on Thursday how we define primary keys on access. But basically, when we go to the table design and we go to this part where we see all the column of the field names or the column names they in the top. Right we can

164
00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:39.169
Nim Dvir: If you find a primary queue, just click on the button primary key. I'll show you that on Thursday we'll open access and and we'll play around

165
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.460
Nim Dvir: in.

166
00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:46.019
Nim Dvir: So surrogate key is

167
00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:50.309
Nim Dvir: kind of like a fake, something that we add in

168
00:37:50.310 --> 00:38:20.129
Nim Dvir: a afterwards, just to have a unique key. So let's say, we have a table for properties. So street, city State zip all those together identity, our composite key. And that's complicated. Usually we try to avoid using so many a a a field is a composite key because it may lead to errors and and would be complicated to write all these things down when we want to pull up the data. So instead, we just create

169
00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:45.520
Nim Dvir: a unique identifier like property Id, and and that's it. And that's a surrogate key. So it doesn't really a exist in real life. But it for the database purposes. It. It helps a I I identify a role. So it's a a circuit key. It's just a column with numbers. And you. You'll see when we move along that that's something that I

170
00:38:45.520 --> 00:39:01.400
Nim Dvir: I usually recommend just to have a column with numbers. as your a primary key, and that's where you put the Id and all of that. So that's a surrogate key. And instead of having multiple and a values, we just use one as a primary.

171
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:30.399
Nim Dvir: A foreign key is when we put a primary key in a a different table. That's the connection. And we symbolize it by using italic. So, for example, let's say we have 2 tables. We have an employee table and a department table. So and department is recognized by the department name. So let's say I'm in the department of the Isba information systems and business analytics. And

172
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:55.369
Nim Dvir: and it's appears sorry if it's one time in the department table and then in the Iba is the code, let's say. And then we have the budget, the office, the phone, all of that one time, and then we have the employee appoint number one. Name the beer, and then Isba, the department that refers to me to the department here. So that's in italic, and that's a foreign key.

173
00:39:55.370 --> 00:40:03.579
Nim Dvir: It just means that the primary key from here is here and that way. If I I want to pull out the data from an

174
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:28.910
Nim Dvir: for the department. So let's say, I want to pull out a the phone number for my department. So I use it using the key. And and I know that in my role a in Isba means which department I am and just points out to the department table and connect them together. Let me ask you a question in the poll. Do you understand the concept of cheese? I

175
00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:34.120
Nim Dvir: I try to explain to you. You also have it in the readings, of course. And

176
00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.279
Nim Dvir: do you

177
00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:46.380
Nim Dvir: the concept of he's

178
00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:05.679
Nim Dvir: okay. Here is a survey. Do you understand the concept of keys? Yes. So so I know.

179
00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:15.030
Nim Dvir: Hey, see? Okay.

180
00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:22.329
Nim Dvir: what with the other people who are participating. I'm guessing you just tuned out. It's unfortunate, and

181
00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:29.920
Nim Dvir: but it gives me some kind of tracking. I see the people who are with me. I understand the concept of keys that's good.

182
00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:42.250
Nim Dvir: And so, I said, a foreign key is when we refer to another table. So, for example, if we have a table for textbook in a table for publishers.

183
00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:46.839
Nim Dvir:  a. A publisher here is a foreign key

184
00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:51.000
Nim Dvir: to the publisher table. It just points out to it.

185
00:41:51.020 --> 00:42:14.810
Nim Dvir: And then we know the textbook. For example, your textbook, a database concept is by Pearson, and then a in the in the publisher table. We have Pearson with the address of Pearson, so which street, city, State, Zip, and all that together. So publisher in a textbook is a foreign key, and that reference a. The publisher role in the publisher table.

186
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:16.300
Nim Dvir: Good.

187
00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:18.560
Nim Dvir: great, and

188
00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:34.849
Nim Dvir: that it's that referential integrity constraints. That's a a very big name for something that's very, very simple. Referral to it, because it just means that a valuable

189
00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:35.940
see it?

190
00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.210
Nim Dvir: Hello! Got it

191
00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:53.189
Nim Dvir: sorry, That the value of a foreign key must match the value of an existing primary key. So that just makes sense. We can have a foreign T without a primary key.

192
00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:57.090
Nim Dvir: It has to point to it in

193
00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:58.939
Nim Dvir: so

194
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:05.480
Nim Dvir: a a foreign key. If we if we use the 40, the primary key must exist. And

195
00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:16.719
Nim Dvir: so it's basically it's a rule. It just means that if it, if a publisher is a foreign key in textbook, it must exist in the publisher table. It's just

196
00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:32.499
Nim Dvir: make sense, you know. We can't do it, and we can do otherwise, because if it doesn't exist, then it doesn't exist, then then we we have nothing to refer to, and we enforce it in excess, which I'll show you on Thursday. Now, I'm

197

Nim Dvir: I hope you know what you need to do. So I'm here.

236
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:57.330
Nim Dvir: That's just so. You want to tell me. You want to remind me again what we're talking about, and you you, if you don't mind.

237
00:49:58.350 --> 00:50:02.570
Jayson Ardon: Yeah. So last night I was going off the

238
00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:04.040
Jayson Ardon: the class like

239
00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:07.779
Nim Dvir: grades and assignments, and I was confused. I was like

240
00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:16.090
Jayson Ardon: how they, when you were going to post the when to do the the excel thing. And then I checked I one thing that I checked the syllabus because

241
00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:29.420
Jayson Ardon: I didn't realize it was already in this little bit. I thought you had it announced it. So I missed it. I was just gonna ask how that would affect my great, I mean, now I know it. So I I'll like, go into my lab and actually do them because I was. I was just confused about that.

242
00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:51.939
Nim Dvir: Well, for the first of all, you can still do so, do whatever you can, and the calculation is very simple. You have you have in the in the service how much each one of them is worth. So you can just do your own Caucasians. You miss something. You see how many points it's worth. And that's basically how many points you lost from your final grade.

243
00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:58.350
Jayson Ardon: Okay? Cause I was, I looked on the my lab thing, and it wouldn't show up anymore so completely.

244
00:50:58.690 --> 00:51:00.559
Jayson Ardon: At least the

245
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:24.460
Nim Dvir: it should be. It should be still up there. But you're gonna lose points for for doing it late. Yeah. A. But just go over the service and see how much they're worth, and you'll see the the simulation. They are not worth a lot of points. I believe it's just one or 2 points each from your final. So it's really not. You still still haven't lost anything. Major.

246
00:51:24.850 --> 00:51:26.160
Jayson Ardon: Okay, okay.

247
00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:28.670
Nim Dvir: cool. And just just keep.

248
00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:51.359
Nim Dvir: Also, you know, I remind you in every lecture, what what you need to do is also just like fit into that. And so so I'm not trying to be your coach here. So yeah, but but you're fine. You're fine, and I mean the first week. It's really like, I take you to consideration that people are, you know, busy still to adjusting. So you'll be fine.

249
00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:53.990
Nim Dvir: Okay.

250
00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:55.820
Jayson Ardon: alright. Thank you

251
00:51:57.730 --> 00:51:59.330
